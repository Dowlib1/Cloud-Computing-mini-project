Throughout this mini project, I learned the critical differences between infrastructure environments and environment variables, and how each plays a unique role in software development and deployment. By developing the `aws_cloud_manager.sh` script, I gained hands-on experience in creating dynamic scripts that adapt to local, testing, and production environments using environment variables and command-line arguments. This approach enabled me to build flexible automation tools that can securely and efficiently manage cloud resources across various stages of the software lifecycle, reinforcing the importance of modular, maintainable, and environment-aware scripting practices in cloud engineering.
