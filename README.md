# Project: AWS Environment Automation Script

This document outlines the requirements for an automated shell script designed to provision a data science environment on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for a client of DataWise Solutions.

---

## üìù Project Overview

The primary goal is to create a shell script that automates the setup of a basic data science workspace on AWS. This is for an e-commerce startup client that needs to analyze customer data. The script will streamline the deployment process by programmatically creating the necessary cloud infrastructure, specifically:

- **Amazon EC2 Instances:** These will serve as the computational servers where data scientists can run their analyses and machine learning models.
- **Amazon S3 Buckets:** These will be used for scalable, secure storage of large datasets, such as customer interaction logs.

The final script should be **reusable, configurable, and robust**, making it easy for DataWise Solutions to deploy similar environments for other clients in the future.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technical Requirements

My understanding is that the script must be built around five key shell scripting concepts to ensure it is efficient, secure, and flexible.

### 1. Functions

The script needs to be modular and easy to read. To achieve this, I will use **custom functions** to encapsulate specific, repeatable tasks. For example, I'll create separate functions like:
- `create_ec2_instance()`: To handle the logic for launching a new EC2 instance.
- `create_s3_bucket()`: To handle the logic for creating a new S3 bucket.
- `verify_deployment()`: To check the status of the created resources and confirm they are running correctly.

This approach makes the main part of the script cleaner and simplifies debugging and future updates.

### 2. Arrays

To effectively manage the resources created by the script, I will use an **array**. This array will store unique identifiers of the created resources, such as the EC2 instance IDs and S3 bucket names. For example: `created_resources=("i-0123456789abcdef0" "my-client-dataset-bucket")`.

Using an array makes it simple to:
- Keep a log of all deployed resources.
- Iterate through the resources to check their status.
- Potentially add a cleanup function that terminates all resources listed in the array.

### 3. Environment Variables

To handle sensitive information and configuration parameters securely and flexibly, the script will rely on **environment variables**. Instead of hard-coding values like AWS access keys, the secret key, or the default region directly into the script, they will be sourced from the environment (e.g., `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `$AWS_REGION`).

This practice is crucial for:
- **Security:** It prevents credentials from being accidentally committed to a version control system like Git.
- **Portability:** The same script can be run in different environments (development, production) just by changing the environment variables, without modifying the code itself.

### 4. Command-Line Arguments

To make the script dynamic and adaptable for different deployment scenarios, it will accept **command-line arguments**. This allows the user to customize key parameters when running the script. For example, a user could specify the desired EC2 instance type or a unique name for the S3 bucket like this:

`./deploy.sh --instance-type t3.medium --bucket-name project-alpha-data`

This feature eliminates the need to edit the script for minor changes and empowers users to tailor the deployment to their specific needs.

### 5. Error Handling

A production-ready script must be resilient. Therefore, robust **error handling** will be implemented throughout. The script will check the exit status of each critical command (especially AWS CLI calls) to see if it succeeded or failed.

If an error is detected (e.g., an S3 bucket name is already taken, or the specified EC2 instance type doesn't exist), the script will:
- Stop execution to prevent further issues.
- Print a clear, informative error message to the user.
- Exit with a non-zero status code to signal failure, which is standard practice for automation workflows.

This ensures the script fails gracefully and provides actionable feedback instead of leaving the environment in a partially configured, broken state.

## üìã Summary of Steps for This Project

To fulfill the requirements, you need to:

1. **Understand the client's data science workspace needs** (EC2 for computation, S3 for data).
2. **Design the shell script** to modularize tasks using functions.
3. **Implement arrays** to track all resources created in the session.
4. **Use environment variables** for security and configuration.
5. **Enable command-line arguments** for customizable deployments.
6. **Add robust error handling** to ensure safe, clear script execution.
7. **Document usage instructions and prerequisites** (to be detailed at implementation time).

## üîó Next Steps

- Draft the shell script skeleton, focusing on the five key shell scripting concepts.
- Prepare usage documentation and environment setup instructions in the next phase.
- Test the script with sample arguments and AWS resources.

*This README summarizes the requirements and initial plan for the automation script. The next phase will focus on implementing the shell script itself, ensuring it meets all outlined technical and functional requirements.*
